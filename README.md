# Strategic SQL Queries – Rockbuster Stealth Movie Analytics

# Project Summary

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company preparing to relaunch as an online video service in response to it's competition from platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in Rockbuster Stealth’s Business Intelligence (BI) team, I helped shape the company’s digital launch strategy by structuring its data in a relational database and using SQL to deliver insights across customer, inventory, and revenue domains.

This portfolio includes the core SQL queries used to explore customer behavior, payment trends, and film performance. Each query reflects a real-world business challenge and is formatted for clarity, reproducibility, and strategic insight.
